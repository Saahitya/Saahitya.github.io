      <description>Overall my memory of the race is very hazy and I remeber very specific parts of the race with not much long term context to it The beginning parts of the race involved a lot of shifting between lanes as some people were running slow and it was still relatively crowded approx for atleast 5-7 kms.
The course through cubbon park was generally very cool and the air there was very fresh.</description>
